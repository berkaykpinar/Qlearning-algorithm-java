# Q Learning Algorithm in Java
 A program finds shortest path in 2 dimension map and avoids randomly generated blocks with using Q-Learning algorithm which is basic machine learning algorithm. After running the project it shows the path in screen and also prints results into Episode via Cost and Episode via Steps graphs. After running the project , the program shows the path in screen and draws results into Episode via Cost and Episode via Steps graphs.
